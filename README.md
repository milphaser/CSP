 CSP support C++ template library

 Folder 0005 containts CSP library 2 sample projects in development stage:
 1. Classical Producer-Consumer Problem
 2. Non-deterministic Consumer Problem
 
 Each of the projects has two editions:
 - traditional with explicit threading;
 - with Actors.
 
 Applications used Embarcadero C++ Builder but are portable to other development platforms. 

 The library itself is the file csp.h which use only C++11 standard features and thus is portable without any change.
